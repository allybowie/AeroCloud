## AeroCloud Tech Test: Hotel Sort Kata (React, Redux)

Please set up by clicking "Clone or Download" to the top right, and type 'git clone {*copied url*}' into a directory in your computer's terminal.

Open the repo in VS-Code using 'code .' if you have that command enabled.

In the VS-Code shell, enter the command 'npm i'; this will install all dependencies.

### Dependencies:
* React
* Redux
* React-Redux

### Dev-Dependencies:
* Mocha
* Chai


## Running The App

Run the app using the command 'npm start' in your shell/terminal

Provided Mocha and Chai are both installed, you may also run the util function test file by using the command
``` npm test ```

The hotels are stored in the Redux store, and can be sorted in ascending and descending order based off the 'Star Rating'; they can also be filtered by checking the boxes for the facilities at the top (if sorted after applying filters, it will sort the current list; sorting does not change the current content.

Enjoy! (and apologies... I didn't quite get onto doing much CSS)!
